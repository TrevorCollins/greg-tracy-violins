        Greg Tracy’s interest in violinmaking and repair began in high school
        under the guidance of his uncle, Ken Beckmann, in Kansas City. Greg’s
        skills were further advanced while attending the Chicago School of
        Violin Making where he studied with Rebecca Elliott and Fred Thompson
        and took part in the first restoration class taught by Henni Hahn. After
        graduating, Greg returned to Kansas to continue working with his uncle
        and apprenticed with Amos Hargrave in Lawrence, Kansas. In 2015, he was
        offered a position at Triangle Strings in Raleigh, North Carolina
        working for Jerry Pasewicz. In 2018, Greg moved to Rochester, NY, where
        he had worked for shops there until 2024.

        Greg has regularly attended the Oberlin Violin Restoration program
        learning from some of the best restorers in the industry. He recently
        relocated to the Pittsburgh area and will be seeing clients from his
        home in Westwood, by appointment only.
